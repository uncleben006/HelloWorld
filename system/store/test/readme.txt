This examples shows how to use set_scroll() and my_scroll() JavaScript functions.

Example01 is a static example where links points to the index.html itself. Intention was to demonstrate how code can be used.
Next in example02 and example03 you will see that "scroll" parameter is sent to the save.php and returned to the main script.
And that is the trick. It is only important to return "scroll" parameter to the main script so vertical scroll position can be set.
